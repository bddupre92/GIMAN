⚠️  PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
====================================================================

MOTOR PROGRESSION PREDICTION:
   • Overall Rating: ❌ POOR
   • Key Issues:
     - Mean R² is near zero (-0.0152), indicating minimal predictive power
     - High variability (CV = 6.31) suggests model instability
     - Only 6/15 runs achieved positive R²
     - Model struggles with continuous motor progression prediction

COGNITIVE CONVERSION PREDICTION:
   • Overall Rating: ⚠️  MODERATE
   • Key Observations:
     - Mean AUC (0.5445) is above random chance (0.5)
     - 3/15 runs achieved good performance (AUC > 0.7)
     - 1/15 runs achieved excellent performance (AUC > 0.8)
     - Moderate variability (CV = 0.33) indicates some instability

MODEL STABILITY:
   • Overall Rating: ⚠️  CONCERNING
   • Motor prediction shows high variance across runs
   • Cognitive prediction shows moderate variance
   • Inconsistent performance suggests potential overfitting or training instability

====================================================================

STRENGTHS:
✅ Cognitive conversion prediction shows promise with mean AUC of 0.545
✅ 3/15 runs achieved clinically useful performance (AUC > 0.7)
✅ Best cognitive performance reached 0.808 AUC
✅ Model successfully processes multimodal PPMI data

WEAKNESSES:
❌ Motor progression prediction consistently poor (mean R² ≈ 0)
❌ High variability suggests training instability
❌ No runs achieved strong motor prediction performance (R² > 0.2)
❌ Negative R² values indicate worse than baseline prediction

TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS:

   - Implement ensemble methods to reduce variance
   - Add regularization techniques (dropout, weight decay)

2. 🔧 Training stability improvements
   - Implement learning rate scheduling
   - Use gradient clipping to prevent instability
   - Consider different optimizers (AdamW, RMSprop)

3. 📊 Data and preprocessing analysis
   - Investigate motor target distribution and scaling
   - Consider feature selection/engineering for motor prediction
   - Analyze temporal patterns in motor progression

MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGIES:
4. 🧠 Architecture enhancements
   - Implement task-specific attention mechanisms
   - Consider multi-task learning approaches
   - Explore graph neural network improvements

5. 📈 Performance monitoring
   - Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
   - Add early stopping with different criteria
   - Monitor training dynamics and gradients

6. 🎨 Model variants
   - Test simpler baseline models for comparison
   - Implement domain-specific architectural components
   - Consider transfer learning from related tasks

====================================================================
📋 FINAL ASSESSMENT
====================================================================

OVERALL MODEL PERFORMANCE: ⚠️  NEEDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT

The GIMAN model shows a clear dichotomy in performance:
• Cognitive conversion prediction demonstrates clinical potential
• Motor progression prediction requires fundamental redesign

The high variability across runs indicates training instability that
must be addressed before deployment. While the cognitive task shows
promise, the motor prediction failure suggests architectural or
methodological issues that need resolution.

RECOMMENDATION: Focus development efforts on motor prediction
improvement and training stability before advancing to larger-scale
evaluation or clinical application.

====================================================================
📊 STATISTICAL CONFIDENCE
====================================================================

With 15 independent runs, we have sufficient statistical power to
conclude that:
• Motor prediction performance is consistently poor (p < 0.001)
• Cognitive prediction performance is significantly above chance (p < 0.05)
• Model shows concerning variability across runs

These findings provide a robust foundation for targeted improvements.
