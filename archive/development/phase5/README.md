# GIMAN Phase 5: Architectural Refinements & Dynamic Comparison

=====================================================

## Phase 5 Mission

Building on Phase 4's successful calibration (Cognitive AUC = 0.6883), Phase 5 implements dynamic architectural refinements to address the fundamental task competition between motor regression and cognitive classification.

## Key Architectural Innovations

### 1. Task-Specific Towers

- **Motor Tower**: Deep regression-specific pathway with continuous activation
- **Cognitive Tower**: Classification-specific pathway with binary activation
- **Shared Backbone**: Common GAT and multimodal attention layers

### 2. Dynamic Loss Weighting

- **Adaptive Balancing**: 0.7 motor + 0.3 cognitive weighted loss
- **Task-Specific Metrics**: Independent evaluation of each pathway
- **Competition Mitigation**: Reduced interference between tasks

### 3. Enhanced Evaluation Framework

- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Phase 4 vs Phase 5 performance
- **Architectural Ablation**: Component-wise contribution analysis
- **Dynamic Monitoring**: Real-time task competition tracking

## Foundation from Phase 4

### Proven Capabilities

- ✅ **Cognitive AUC = 0.6883**: Demonstrates model can learn meaningful patterns
- ✅ **LOOCV Framework**: Robust 95-patient evaluation system
- ✅ **Data Quality**: Zero NaN/Inf values across all modalities
- ✅ **Architecture Soundness**: Node-level predictions working correctly

### Identified Challenges

- ⚠️ **Task Competition**: Motor regression vs cognitive classification competing for capacity
- ⚠️ **Optimal Balance**: Current best at R² = -0.0254, AUC = 0.5574
- ⚠️ **Architectural Limitations**: Single pathway for dual tasks
