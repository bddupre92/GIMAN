PPMI 3 LONGITUDINAL DATASET EXPANSION PLAN
================================================================================
Generated: 2025-09-26 21:47:15

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
• We have identified 21 longitudinal patients
• Total longitudinal sessions: 42
• This is a 10x increase from our previous 2-patient cohort
• Expected to significantly improve GIMAN model training and validation

MODALITY BREAKDOWN:
• DATSCAN:
  - Patients: 4
  - Total DICOMs: 8
  - Avg follow-up: 388 days
• DaTSCAN:
  - Patients: 10
  - Total DICOMs: 20
  - Avg follow-up: 369 days
• MPRAGE:
  - Patients: 1
  - Total DICOMs: 384
  - Avg follow-up: 216 days
• SAG_3D_MPRAGE:
  - Patients: 6
  - Total DICOMs: 2,304
  - Avg follow-up: 354 days

CONVERSION REQUIREMENTS:
• Structural MRI: 7 patients, 14 sessions
• DAT-SPECT: 14 patients, 28 sessions

PHASED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

High-Priority Structural MRI (6 patients):
  Priority: HIGH
  Patients: 7
  Description: Convert structural MRI for patients with longest follow-up
  Estimated time: 2-3 hours
  Patient IDs: 100960, 101021, 100712, 100232, 100677...

High-Priority DAT-SPECT (10 patients):
  Priority: HIGH
  Patients: 14
  Description: Convert DAT-SPECT for patients with longest follow-up
  Estimated time: 1-2 hours
  Patient IDs: 130828, 213006, 293487, 239732, 140568...

Remaining Longitudinal Patients (5 patients):
  Priority: MEDIUM
  Patients: 0
  Description: Convert remaining longitudinal imaging data
  Estimated time: 1-2 hours
  Patient IDs: 

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
• Robust longitudinal dataset for 3D CNN + GRU architecture
• Multiple timepoints per patient (avg ~1 year follow-up)
• Both structural and functional imaging modalities
• Sufficient data for proper train/validation/test splits
• Ability to study disease progression patterns

NEXT STEPS:
1. Install/verify dcm2niix conversion tool
2. Execute Phase 1: High-priority structural MRI conversion
3. Execute Phase 2: High-priority DAT-SPECT conversion
4. Validate converted NIfTI files
5. Execute Phase 3: Remaining conversions
6. Update GIMAN preprocessing pipeline for expanded dataset
7. Begin 3D CNN + GRU training with longitudinal cohort

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
• dcm2niix converter (for DICOM → NIfTI conversion)
• ~2-3 GB additional storage for expanded NIfTI files
• Updated data loading pipelines for larger cohort
• Longitudinal data handling in GIMAN architecture
