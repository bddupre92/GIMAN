### **Epic 1: Foundational Environment and Project Setup**

# **Epic: Establish a Reproducible GIMAN Preprocessing Environment**

## **Strategic Context**

To ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of our GIMAN model research, we must begin with a standardized and isolated development environment. A consistent setup prevents dependency conflicts, simplifies collaboration, and guarantees that any researcher can replicate our data preprocessing results exactly. This foundational work is critical for building a reliable and robust data pipeline.

## **Epic Description**

This epic covers the complete setup of the local development environment for the GIMAN data preprocessing project. It includes creating an organized project structure, initializing a version control system, setting up an isolated Python environment, and installing all necessary libraries for data analysis and neuroimaging.

## **Target Personas**

* **Data Scientist/ML Researcher:** Will be able to immediately start the project with a fully configured environment, avoiding setup friction and ensuring consistency.  
* **New Team Member:** Can quickly onboard and replicate the project setup by following a simple set of commands, reducing ramp-up time.

## **Business Value**

* **Accelerated Research:** A standardized environment eliminates time wasted on troubleshooting setup issues, allowing the team to focus on data analysis.  
* **Enhanced Reproducibility:** Ensures that our research findings are verifiable and scientifically sound.  
* **Improved Collaboration:** A shared, version-controlled setup allows for seamless collaboration and code sharing among team members.

## **Success Metrics**

* **Environment Setup Time:** A new team member can set up the entire environment and run a "hello world" data script in under 15 minutes.  
* **Dependency Consistency:** All team members' environments have identical versions of the core libraries.

## **Dependencies & Constraints**

* Requires a local installation of Python 3.8+ and Git.  
* The project will be developed primarily within VS Code.

## **Epic-Level Acceptance Criteria**

1. The project has a clean, logical directory structure with separate folders for data, notebooks, and scripts.  
2. A Git repository is successfully initialized in the project's root directory.  
3. A dedicated Python virtual environment exists and can be activated.  
4. All required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.) are installed and importable within the virtual environment.

## **Technical Considerations**

* The choice between venv and conda for environment management should be standardized across the team (venv is recommended for simplicity).  
* A requirements.txt file should be generated to lock down dependency versions.

## **Timeline & Priority**

* **Priority:** Must-have  
* **Target Release:** Sprint 1  
* **Estimated Epic Size:** S (Small)

## **Constituent User Stories**

* \[ \] Create Standard Project Directory Structure  
* \[ \] Initialize Git Version Control  
* \[ \] Establish Isolated Python Virtual Environment  
* \[ \] Install Core Python Dependencies

# **User Story: Create Standard Project Directory Structure**

## **Story**

As a Data Scientist,  
I want to have a standardized and logical folder structure,  
So that I can keep project files (data, code, notebooks) organized and easy to locate.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. A root folder named GIMAN\_PPMI\_Project is created.  
2. Inside the root, the following subdirectories exist: data/raw, data/processed, notebooks, scripts.  
3. The .vscode directory is created with the instructions.md file inside.

## **Technical Considerations**

* This can be created manually or with a simple bash script.

## **Definition of Done**

* All specified folders are created in the correct hierarchy.  
* The structure is committed as the initial commit in the Git repository.

## **Dependencies**

* None

# **User Story: Initialize Git Version Control**

## **Story**

As a Researcher,  
I want to initialize a Git repository for the project,  
So that I can track all code changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. The git init command is run in the project's root directory.  
2. A .gitignore file is created and configured to ignore common Python and environment files (e.g., .venv, \_\_pycache\_\_, .env).  
3. The initial project structure is committed to the main branch.

## **Technical Considerations**

* A standard Python .gitignore template should be used.

## **Definition of Done**

* The project is a functional Git repository.  
* The first commit is pushed to a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub).

* User Story: Create Standard Project Directory Structure

# **User Story: Establish Isolated Python Virtual Environment**

## **Story**

As a Data Scientist,  
I want to create an isolated Python virtual environment,  
So that project dependencies are managed separately and do not conflict with my system's global Python installation.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. A virtual environment is created inside the project root directory (e.g., named .venv).  
2. The virtual environment can be successfully activated and deactivated from the VS Code terminal.  
3. The Python interpreter within VS Code is correctly configured to point to the virtual environment's interpreter.

## **Technical Considerations**

* Using Python's built-in venv module is the recommended approach.  
* The .gitignore file must be updated to exclude the .venv directory from version control.

## **Definition of Done**

* The virtual environment is created and functional.  
* The VS Code workspace is configured to use the environment by default.

## **Dependencies**

* None

# **User Story: Install Core Python Dependencies**

## **Story**

As an ML Researcher,  
I want to install all the necessary Python libraries for data analysis,  
So that I can begin loading and manipulating the PPMI dataset.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. With the virtual environment activated, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn are installed using pip.  
2. A requirements.txt file is generated from the installed packages (pip freeze \> requirements.txt).  
3. All libraries can be imported without error in a Python script or notebook running in the configured environment.

## **Technical Considerations**

* Pinning versions in requirements.txt is crucial for reproducibility.

## **Definition of Done**

* All core libraries are installed.  
* The requirements.txt file is created and committed to the Git repository.

## **Dependencies**

* User Story: Establish Isolated Python Virtual Environment
