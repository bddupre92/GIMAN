## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks:
1. **Risk:** LOOCV shows inconsistent performance across folds
   - **Mitigation:** Analyze patient characteristics, stratify by disease stage
   
2. **Risk:** Regularization reduces performance too much
   - **Mitigation:** Systematic grid search, performance vs. complexity trade-off

3. **Risk:** Data expansion doesn't improve generalization
   - **Mitigation:** Quality validation, careful preprocessing, baseline comparison

### Research Risks:
1. **Risk:** Model simplification loses GIMAN novelty
   - **Mitigation:** Maintain core GAT components, gradual complexity increase

2. **Risk:** Small dataset fundamentally limits approach
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on proof-of-concept, document limitations clearly

## üí° Key Insights & Principles

1. **Start Simple:** Establish working baseline before adding complexity
2. **Validate Everything:** LOOCV provides honest performance assessment
3. **Regularize Aggressively:** Small datasets require strong regularization
4. **Data Quality First:** Clean data is more important than complex models
5. **Incremental Progress:** Each change should show measurable improvement

---

**Next Action:** Fix temporal embedding NaN corruption immediately - this is blocking all progress.

**Decision Point:** After Epic 1 completion, evaluate if regularization alone achieves target performance or if data expansion is required.

**Success Criteria:** Positive R¬≤ and training stability are non-negotiable milestones before proceeding to complexity increases.
