3. **🏔️ Hierarchical Attention Fusion**
   - Patient-level and population-level attention
   - Multi-scale attention aggregation
   - Similarity-guided attention weighting

4. **📊 Advanced Attention Pooling**
   - Flexible sequence aggregation mechanisms
   - Multiple pooling strategies (mean, max, attention-weighted)
   - Learnable pooling parameters

5. **🧠 Enhanced Multi-Modal GAT** (`enhanced_multimodal_gat.py`)
   - Integration of Phase 3.2 attention with Phase 3.1 GAT
   - Interpretable prognostic prediction heads
